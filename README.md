# EFI OPENCORE Hackintosh
For 6th gen (skylake) intel up to ventura (13) laptops.

Using kabylake framebuffer to spoof macos 12+ since it doesn't support intel hd old gen anymore.

Some bloat on the deviceinfo that needs to be cleaned, unstable, no bluetooth (use broadcom chip)

Wifi works (Intel)
Trackpads & Keyboard Voodo PS2
Brightness works
Keyboard works
etc.

Tested on thinkpad t460p (i5 6440 HQ, HD 530, mostly intel chips)

NOTE: delay on caps lock because slow keys are disabled, but if turning on slow keys will make brightness keys broken (mac os will not respond) i don't know why.
